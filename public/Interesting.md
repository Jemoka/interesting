# Interesting
Every so often, I find something interesting enough such that spam it into people's text/IRC channels. So I thought, instead of doing that, why don't I just put it into a Markdown file published to the internet?

It's like a microblog, but published in a single markdown file. Cool, right? Also, if you want, you could commit to this doc too! Just [make a PR](https://github.com/Jemoka/interesting) or [email me](mailto:hliu@shabang.cf).
